Creating a model, in the context of data science and machine learning, involves building a mathematical representation of a real-world process or system based on available data. The process typically includes several steps:
Data Collection
Data Preprocessing
Feature Engineering
Model Selection
Model Training
Model Evaluation
Model Tuning
